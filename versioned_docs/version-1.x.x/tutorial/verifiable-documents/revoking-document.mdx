It's possible to revoke a signed document only if you fulfill certain **prerequisites**. Any future progress can be followed [here](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/adr/blob/master/issuing_using_did.md#for-documents-that-are-signed-directly).

## Prerequisites:

- an `ethr` DID (if you've been following the above steps, you should have one already)
- some kind of DID documents:
  1. base DID document (`ISSUER_IDENTITY`: `identityProof.identifier` = [`ethr` DID](/docs/topics/introduction/issuer-method-dns-did))
  2. DNS-DID document (`ISSUER_IDENTITY`: `identityProof.identifier` = [DNS-DID](/docs/topics/introduction/issuer-method-dns-did))
- a deployed `documentStore`, click [here](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/deploying-document-store/document-store-cli) for how to do so.
- before you wrap your document with the wrapper SDK, add a `revocation` block with these keys:

```json
{
  "$template": {
    "name": "main",
    "type": "EMBEDDED_RENDERER",
    "url": "https://tutorial-renderer.openattestation.com"
  },
  "recipient": {
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "issuers": [
    {
      ....
      "name": "Demo Issuer",
      "revocation": {
        "type": "REVOCATION_STORE",
        "location": "<DEPLOYED_DOCUMENT_STORE_LOCATION>"
      },
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

- note that the `<DEPLOYED_DOCUMENT_STORE_LOCATION>` is your `documentStore` location, it must be **deployed** on the blockchain (for now. Further implementations will relax this requirement so that DID documents will truly be gasless).
- wrap your document, sign it and appending the signature to the document (follow the tutorial)

## Revoking a document

- once you have achieved the prerequisites, you would have a document that could be revoked on a deployed `documentStore`.
- how one does this is by simply invoking the command to revoke a document:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="CLI" value="cli" default>

```bash
tradetrust document-store revoke --address <DOCUMENT_STORE_ADDRESS> --hash <HASH_OF_DOCS>  --network <NETWORK> --encrypted-wallet-path <PATH_OF_WALLET>
```

In the example above:

- `--address` is the document store address, for instance the one created with the [Deploying Document Store](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/deploying-document-store/document-store-cli) guide.
- `--hash` is the value of `targetHash` field of one of the [previously wrapped documents](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) (open one of the file, head to the bottom and check for the `targetHash` in the `signature` object.)

You will be prompted for the password that you used while creating the wallet. You will see a message after completion of the command:

```bash
âœ”  success   Document/Document Batch with hash 0x1e0c5e93c04032ed6571b31c785b963f0a27776041f35bdcc98cd8dfe073adc0 has been revoked on 0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b
```

<TabItem label="Code" value="code">

```ts
const unconnectedWallet = new Wallet("privateKey");
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("http://127.0.0.1:8545"); // Local network
const wallet = unconnectedWallet.connect(provider);

const documentStore = DocumentStoreFactory.connect("0x63A223E025256790E88778a01f480eBA77731D04", wallet);

## Alternate way to Revoke a document (OCSP)

Alternately, you can also revoke a document using your own Online certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder. Simply put, an OCSP responder would be a service that would respond with the revocation status of a certificate and the reason it was revoked.

### Revocation type and location

You would require a DID document with

- `revocation.type`: `OCSP_RESPONDER`
- `revocation.locatioin`: `https://ocsp-sandbox.openattestation.com`

You should use your own OCSP responder if you have one deployed. Otherwise, you can demo this feature using the [Open Attestation OCSP Responder](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/ocsp-responder)

```json
{
  "$template": {
    "name": "main",
    "type": "EMBEDDED_RENDERER",
    "url": "https://tutorial-renderer.openattestation.com"
  },
  "recipient": {
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "issuers": [
    {
      ....
      "name": "Demo Issuer",
      "revocation": {
        "type": "OCSP_RESPONDER",
        "location": "<OCSP_RESPONDER_URL>"
      },
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

### Revoking a document

Refer to [this readme](https://github.com/Open-Attestation/ocsp-responder/blob/main/README.md) to learn how to add a document to the OA OCSP Responder.

## Verifying the document

Head to [dev.tradetrust.io](https://dev.tradetrust.io/verify) and drag and drop the revoked document. An error will be displayed on the webpage.

![Successful verification](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/ethereum/revoking-document/verifying.png)

The document has been revoked, thus, we do not display the content of the document on our document viewer.

## Revoking multiple documents

If you open the [previously wrapped documents](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) side by side, you will notice:

- they have a different `targetHash`: it uniquely identifies any document
- they have the same `merkleRoot`: it uniquely identifies any group of wrapped documents.

When you revoke a document you can use any of those hash, but the result will be different depending on the one used:

- when using the `targetHash`, only the document will be revoked.
- when using the `merkleRoot`, all the documents wrapped together (in the same batch) will be revoked.

If you run again the command above, by using the `merkleRoot` of the documents, then all documents will be revoked.

## Misc questions:

Q: hey you mentioned that if I use DID documents, I would not need to pay for transactions, but following this flow, I would still have to pay for at least 1 transaction (deploying a `documentStore`), what gives?

A: yes, you are right, for now this implementation will still need at least 1 transaction to the ethereum blockchain. We are working on this so please be patient and watch this space.

Q: this might be a weird question but I did not issue any documents from the deployed `documentStore`, how am I able to revoke this document from said `documentStore` when in the first place, I did not even issue anything?

A: long story short, the revocation mapping in the `documentStore` is a separate mapping from the issued mapping.
