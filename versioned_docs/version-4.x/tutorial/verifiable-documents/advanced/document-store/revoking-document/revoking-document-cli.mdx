import Flow from "../flow.mdx";

<Flow />

> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/4.x/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/revoking-document/revoking-document-cli) or [Code](/docs/4.x/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/revoking-document/revoking-document-code).

After issuing a document, you might want to revoke it for any reason:

- the information provided by the recipient was wrong.
- the information in the document are outdated.
- there is a problem in the document.
- etc.

## Revoking a document

```bash
tradetrust document-store revoke --address 0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b --hash 0x1e0c5e93c04032ed6571b31c785b963f0a27776041f35bdcc98cd8dfe073adc0  --network sepolia --encrypted-wallet-path wallet.json
```

In the example above:

- `--address` is the document store address, for instance the one created with the [Deploying Document Store](/docs/4.x/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/deploying-document-store/document-store-cli) guide.
- `--hash` is the value of `targetHash` field of one of the [previously wrapped documents](/docs/4.x/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) (open one of the file, head to the bottom and check for the `targetHash` in the `signature` object.

You will be prompted for the password that you used while creating the wallet. You will see a message after completion of the command:

```text
âœ”  success   Document/Document Batch with hash 0x1e0c5e93c04032ed6571b31c785b963f0a27776041f35bdcc98cd8dfe073adc0 has been revoked on 0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b
```

## Verifying the document

Head to [dev.tradetrust.io](https://dev.tradetrust.io/verify) and drag and drop the revoked document. An error will be displayed by the portal.

![Successful verification](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/ethereum/revoking-document/verifying.png)

The document has been revoked, thus, we do not display the content of the document on our document viewer.

## Revoking multiple documents

If you open the [previously wrapped documents](/docs/4.x/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) side by side, you will notice:

- they have a different `targetHash`: it uniquely identifies any document
- they have the same `merkleRoot`: it uniquely identifies any group of wrapped documents.

When you revoke a document you can use any of those hash, but the result will be different depending on the one used:

- when using the `targetHash`, only the document will be revoked.
- when using the `merkleRoot`, all the documents wrapped together (in the same batch) will be revoked.

If you run again the command above, by using the `merkleRoot` of the documents, then all document will be revoked.

## Misc questions:

Q: hey you mentioned that if I use DID documents, I would not need to pay for transactions, but following this flow, I would still have to pay for at least 1 transaction (deploying a `documentStore`), what gives?

A: yes, you are right, for now this implementation will still need at least 1 transaction to the ethereum blockchain. We are working on this so please be patient and watch this space.

Q: this might be a weird question but I did not issue any documents from the deployed `documentStore`, how am I able to revoke this document from said `documentStore` when in the first place, I did not even issue anything?

A: long story short, the revocation mapping in the `documentStore` is a separate mapping from the issued mapping.
