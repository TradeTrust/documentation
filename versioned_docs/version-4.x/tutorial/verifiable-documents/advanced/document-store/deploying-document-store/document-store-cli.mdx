> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/4.x/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/deploying-document-store/document-store-cli) or [Code](/docs/4.x/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/deploying-document-store/document-store-code).

The document store is a smart contract on the blockchain network that records the issuance and revocation status of TradeTrust documents. In this guide, we will deploy a document store smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, `sepolia` network, which is a test network that does not require actual [ethers](/docs/4.x/topics/appendix/glossary#ether) for transactions.

In this guide, we will deploy a document store smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, `sepolia` network which is a test network that does not require actual ethers for transactions

## Prerequisite

- [TradeTrust CLI](/docs/4.x/tutorial/prerequisites#installation-of-tradetrust-cli) installed
- Private key to an [Ethereum wallet](/docs/4.x/tutorial/prerequisites#wallet-creation) with sufficient ethers

## Deploying via TradeTrust CLI

```bash
tradetrust deploy document-store "My first document store" --network sepolia --encrypted-wallet-path wallet.json
```

You will be prompted for the password that you used while creating the wallet. Once your document store smart contract has been successfully deployed, you will see the success message with the document store address.

```text

```

In the example above, the document store address is `0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b`, please do **NOT** use the Transaction ID.

**Save the document store address somewhere.** You will need this address later to complete the tutorial.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a document store.

Next we take a look at configuring the DNS.
