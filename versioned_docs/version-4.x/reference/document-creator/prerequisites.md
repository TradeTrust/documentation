Before you construct your configuration file(`.json` file), please ensure you have these:

- [Wallet (`.json` file)](/docs/tutorial/prerequisites#wallet-creation)
- [Document Store (for verifiable document)](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/advanced/document-store/deploying-document-store/document-store-cli)
- [Token Registry (for transferable document)](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/token-registry/token-registry-cli)
- [Configured DNS](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/dns)
- [Decentralised Renderer](/docs/tutorial/decentralised-renderer/)
- [Document Storage for QR code generation](/docs/reference/tradetrust-website/qr-code) (Optional)

Please refer to the appropriate links to prepare them.

Once you have all the required prerequisite, you can proceed to construct your very own configuration file. In the next section we will deep dive into the configuration file, the structure and where to place the relevant information in the config file.
