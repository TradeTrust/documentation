# ðŸš€ Deploying Document Store Smart Contract

The document store is a smart contract on the Ethereum network that records the issuance and revocation status of TT documents. In this guide, we will deploy a document store smart contract on the Ethereum `ropsten` network, which is a test network that does not require actual ethers for transactions.
There are 2 methods of deploying the store: [using the OA-CLI tool](#using-oa-cli-tool)

## Using OA-CLI tool

In this guide we will make use of a Open Attestation wallet.

### Prerequisites
- [Open Attestation CLI tool](https://openattestation.com/docs/component/open-attestation-cli)
- [Open Attestation Wallet](https://openattestation.com/docs/verifiable-document/wallet)

Run the following line using the OA CLI tool.

```bash
open-attestation deploy document-store "My first document store" --network ropsten --encrypted-wallet-path wallet.json
```

You will be prompted for the password that you used while creating the wallet. Once your document store smart contract has been successfully deployed, you will see the success message with the document store address.

```text
â„¹  info      Deploying document store My first document store

â€¦  awaiting  Decrypting Wallet [====================] [100/100%]

```

In the example above, the document store address is `0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b`, please do **NOT** use the Transaction ID.

**Save the document store address somewhere as the cli tool does not keep track of your document store addresses.**
