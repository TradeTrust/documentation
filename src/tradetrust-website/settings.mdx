# TradeTrust Website

The TradeTrust website allows you to create and verify documents, view resources and contact the team should
you have any queries. There is also a gear icon on the far right of the navigation bar which enables you to configure the 
settings to add Address Resolvers.

## Settings: Address Resolver

In the settings page you can add your Address Resolver. It enables you to add a third party's endpoint to resolve 
Ethereum addresses to their entity's name. With Ethereum addresses being cryptic to end users, this Address Resolver
will act as a digital "yellow pages", allowing end users to see familiar identifiers such as `ABC Pte Ltd`. Once the 
Address Resolver endpoint has been added, when you verify a document with an identifiable Ethereum address, it will 
look like the following:

[Address-resolved](./address-resolved.png)

You can see that the entity's name, resolver details and source will also be displayed above the resolved Ethereum 
address.

_Note: There is a difference between "Resolved by" and "Source" parameters. Resolved by refers to the naming of the 3rd 
party resolver that the user has set in the settings page. Source (an optional field) refers to information that is 
verified by another party. For example, in NDI Myinfo, they have verified information from different agencies._

## How to setup an Address Resolver:

We will need to specify the following fields in the API:

-Identifier (The ethereum address of the entity)
-Name (The name of the entity)
-Remarks (_Optional:Additional information about the entity_)
-Source (_Optional:The source of the information_)

A detailed explanation can be found at https://github.com/Open-Attestation/adr/blob/master/identifier_resolution_api.md.

A reference implementation of this service can be found at 
https://github.com/Open-Attestation/demo-identifier-resolver.

## How to add an Address Resolver:

Clicking the "+ Add" button in the settings page will show you following:

[Settings](./settings.png)

We will need:

-[Name](#name)
-[Endpoint](#endpoint)
-[API Header and API Key](#api-header-and-api-key)

---

## Name

The "Name" input refers to the name of the address resolver that contains all the mappings of entities and their respective 
Ethereum address. For example, "BANKS.SG" could be the address resolver for all banks in Singapore.

---

## Endpoint

The "Endpoint" input refers to the endpoint that will be called to resolve an Ethereum Address. 
A hosted endpoint is available at [https://demo-resolver.tradetrust.io/identifier/](https://demo-resolver.tradetrust.io/identifier/).

---

## API Header and API Key

For the API to know that you are an authorised user, an API Key is required and you will need to pass it in through an
API Header. An example would be `x-api-key` for the API Header and `DEMO` for the API Key.
