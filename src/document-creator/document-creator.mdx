- [Token Registry (for transferable document)](./token-registry)
- [Configured DNS](/dns-txt#how-to-create-dns-txt-record)
- [Custom Renderer](./custom-template)

Please refer to the approprate links to prepare them.

}
```

### `"network"` field

The `network` field is a string that refers to the network in which the document is created in.

### `"wallet"` field

```json
{
  "name": "Demo Bill of Lading",
  "type": "TRANSFERABLE_RECORD",
  "defaults": {...},
  "schema": {...},

### `"type"` field

The `type` field is a string that reters to the type of the document, either `"TRANSFERABLE_RECORD"` or `"VERIFIABLE_DOCUMENT"`.

### `"defaults"` field

The `defaults` field is an object that contains the settings that you have that are constant among the different documents of the same kind of file.

Usually the document store address, token registry address, template, issuers, company logo, signatures, etc. are stored here, since they are a constant in the different documents of the same kind.

Default value of the form should also be stored here.

For example, you can store a default value for a `"title"` field here, this value will be used in the form shema as the value for the `"title"` field.

An example of the `"defaults"` field:

```json
"defaults": {
  "$template": {
    "type": "EMBEDDED_RENDERER",
    "name": "BILL_OF_LADING",
    "url": "https://demo-cnm.openattestation.com"
  },
  "issuers": [
    {
      "identityProof": {
        "type": "DNS-TXT",
        "location": "isaactest.xyz"
      },
      "name": "Demo Issuer",
      "tokenRegistry": "0x6D489a6A2cbcB76FcEeA26102d1273cd4d3B6b10"
    }
  ],
  "name": "Demo bill of lading"
}
```

#### `"$template"` field

The `$template` field is an object that refers to the custom renderer, please refer to [creating document renderer](https://openattestation.com/docs/advanced/custom-renderer).

#### `"issuers"` field

The `issuers` is an array of the issuer object. The required fields for each issuer are `name`, `identityProof` and one of `documentStore` OR `tokenRegistry`.

Transferrable document requires a [`tokenRegistry`](./token-registry), where as, a verifiable document requires a [`documentStore`](./deploying-store).

The `name` field is a string, please refer to [token registry](./token-registry-store) for transferable document or [deploying document store](./deploying-store) for verifiable document, for more information.

The `tokenRegistry` field is a string, please refer to [token registry](./token-registry-store) for more information.

The `documentStore` field is a string, please refer to [deploying document store](./deploying-store) for more information.

The `identityProof` field is an object that refers to the issuer identity, please refer to [open attestation's identity Proof](https://openattestation.com/docs/advanced/identity-proofs) for more information.

### `"schema"` field

The `"schema"` field is an object used to generate a form. It follows [JSON schema format.](https://json-schema.org/)

The structure of the schema will derived from the structure of the document you expect to build and will be inline with the custom renderer that you have built for this document.

It will probably be a subset of an already existing schema without the data that you expect to be constants accross your document.

An example of the `"schema"` field:

```json
"schema": {
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["blNumber"],
  "properties": {
    "blNumber": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "BL number"
    }
  }
}
```

### `"Attachments"` field

The `"attachments"` field contains the information about the required attachments for this document.

If there are no attachment for the particular form that you are creating, please set `"allow"` field to false.

An example of the `"attachments"` field:

```
"attachments": {
  "allow": true,
  "accept": [".pdf", ".tt", ".json", ".jpg"]
}
```

The `"allow"` accepts a boolean value(true or false) and it will display the attachment section based on this value.

The `"accept"` accepts an array of string, that are file types, which will set the accepted file types for the attachments.

If you want to accept all file types, remove the entire `"accept"` line from `"attachments"` object.
