To use this functionality, you will need a configuration file(`.json` file) and some pre-requisite informations.

## What is document creator about?

It's to provide a UI to the staffs that are involve with the daily operations who do not need to know anything about blockchain.

## Why do we do this?

Mainly because we want to cater to small firms or companies that doesn't really have the capabilities to build deep integration with their existing softwares or workflows.

## How is this document creator helping small firms and companies?

## Pre-requisite

Before you construct your configuration file(`.json` file), please ensure you have these:

- [Etherum Wallet](./deploying-store)
- [Document Store (for verifiable document)](./deploying-store)

## Configuration file

This configuration file is a JSON file that contains information to configure the application to suit your business needs.

### Forms structure

The `forms` field is an array of form object. The required fields for each form is `name`, `type`, `defaults` and `schema`. Other field such as `attachments` is also recognised.

```json

```

### `"name"` field

The `name` field is a string that refers to the name of the document.

### `"type"` field

The `type` field is a string that reters to the type of the document, either `"TRANSFERABLE_RECORD"` or `"VERIFIABLE_DOCUMENT"`.

### `"defaults"` field

The `defaults` field is an object that contains the settings that you have that are constant among the different documents of the same kind of file.

Usually the document store address, token registry address, template, issuers, company logo, signatures, etc. are stored here, since they are a constant in the different documents of the same kind.

An example of the `"defaults"` field:

```json
"defaults": {
  "$template": {
    "type": "EMBEDDED_RENDERER",
    "name": "BILL_OF_LADING",
    "url": "https://demo-cnm.openattestation.com"
  },
  "issuers": [
    {
      "identityProof": {
        "type": "DNS-TXT",
        "location": "isaactest.xyz"
      },
      "name": "Demo Issuer",
      "tokenRegistry": "0x6D489a6A2cbcB76FcEeA26102d1273cd4d3B6b10"
    }
  ],
  "name": "Demo bill of lading"
}
```

#### `"$template"` field

The `$tempalte` field is an object that contains information about the [custom rendering template](./custom-template).

#### `"issuers"` field

The `issuers` is an array of the issuer object. The required fields for each issuer are `name`, `identityProof` and one of `documentStore` OR `tokenRegistry`.

Transferrable document will use a [`tokenRegistry`](./token-registry), where as, a verifiable document will use a `documentStore`.

The `name` field is a string that refers to the name of the issuer.

The `tokenRegistry` field is a string that refers to the address in which you deploy the token registry.

The `documentStore` field is a string that refers to the address in which you deploy the document store.

The `identityProof` field is an object that requires the field `type` and `location`.

The `type` field is a string that refers to the type of configuration you have set up.

The `location` field is a string that refers to the domain url in which you have set up the configured DNS.

### `"schema"` field

For the schema we are using JSON schema to populate the form.

The construction of the schema is defived from when you are constructing your custom renderer.

The fields in here must match the one in your specific custom renderer.

If not it will now display on the custom renderer.

An example of the `"schema"` field:

```json
"schema": {
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["blNumber"],
  "properties": {
    "blNumber": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "BL number"
    },
    "item": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Goods"
    }
  }
}
```

### `"Attachments"` field

This `"attachments"` field contains the information about the required attachments for this document.

An example of the `"attachments"` field:

```
"attachments": {
  "allow": true,
  "accept": ".pdf, .tt, .json, .jpg"
}
```

The `"allow"` accepts a boolean value(true or false) and it will display the attachment section based on this value.

The `"accept"` set the accepted file types. If you want to accept all file types, remove the entire `"accept"` from `"attachments"`.
