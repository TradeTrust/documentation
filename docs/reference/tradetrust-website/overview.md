Tradetrust verifier website is a place where you can verify any of the `Transferable Records` or `Verifiable Documents` that you issued. It is also a place to look out for webinar tutorials, latest media mentions, FAQs and much more.

Please keep in mind that TradeTrust has 2 environments, each connecting to different ethereum networks:

- Mainnets (Ethereum, Polygon) = http://tradetrust.io
- Testnets (Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, XDC Apothem, Stability Testnet and Hedera Testnet) = http://dev.tradetrust.io

The next few topics are going to explain on some of the features the website provides.
