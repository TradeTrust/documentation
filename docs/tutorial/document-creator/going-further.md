Now that you have completed the getting started guide to create your own `Configuration File`, you can customise your config file by **replacing the forms in the forms section with your own customised forms**, so you can create and issue your own custom documents.

Alternatively, you can read the following information to understand how the configuration file works:

- [Document Creator Overview](/docs/topics/document-creator/overview)
- [How does the verification work?](/docs/topics/verification/introduction)
- [Configuring DNS](/docs/reference/configuration/configure-dns)
- [Creating a Custom Renderer](/docs/reference/configuration/create-custom-renderer)
