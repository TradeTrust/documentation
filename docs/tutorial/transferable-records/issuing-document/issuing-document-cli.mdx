import Flow from "../flow.mdx";

<Flow />

> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/issuing-document/issuing-document-cli) or [Code](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/issuing-document/issuing-document-code).

In this final step, we will mint the transferable record and initialize the first owner and holder for the title escrow.

## Prerequisite

You will require the following:

- [token registry address](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/token-registry/token-registry-cli)
- [wallet private key file](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/token-registry/token-registry-cli#creating-the-key-file) (key.txt)
- [merkle root](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) of the wrapped transferable record

## Minting a Transferable Record

In the example, we will use `0x6FFeD6E6591b808130a9b248fEA32101b5220eca` wallet address as the initial owner and holder. You will need to replace this value with a wallet address you control to be able to perform different actions on the transferable records later.

To mint the transferable record, simply run the following command:

```sh
tradetrust token-registry mint --address 0x8431012Bc040942B59e3C5bf428221eab0b2f723 --tokenId 0x0d9839a8034cb783d98bd57bcbaafb4dc3614c4193d2edf8a655c1ec6635b7ea --beneficiary 0x6FFeD6E6591b808130a9b248fEA32101b5220eca --holder 0x6FFeD6E6591b808130a9b248fEA32101b5220eca --remark "This is a test remark" --encryptionKey "testEncryptionKey" --network sepolia -f key.txt
```

Note to replace the following values:

- --address: `0x8431012Bc040942B59e3C5bf428221eab0b2f723` with your token registry contract address
- --tokenId: `0x0d9839a8034cb783d98bd57bcbaafb4dc3614c4193d2edf8a655c1ec6635b7ea` with your merkle root (with a `0x` prefix)
- --beneficiary: `0x6FFeD6E6591b808130a9b248fEA32101b5220eca` with your owner wallet addresses
- --holder: `0x6FFeD6E6591b808130a9b248fEA32101b5220eca` with your holder wallet addresses
- --remark: `This is a test remark` with your mint remark
- --encryptionKey: `testEncryptionKey` with your encryption key

> Note: remark and encryptionKey are optional.

Once the document has been minted, you will be able to see an output similar to the following:

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you have completed the getting started guide and minted your first transferable record.

## Verifying your transferable record

To verify your transferable record, simply head over the https://dev.tradetrust.io/verify. You will be able to drop your transferable record (found in `wrapped-documents` folder from the previous steps) into the dropzone and see something similar to the following:

![Completed Transferable Record](/docs/tutorial/transferable-records/issuing-transferable-record/completed.png)

Notice you are able to click on `Connect Wallet` when logged in to either the owner or holder to gain access to actions to change the ownership and holdership of the transferable record.
