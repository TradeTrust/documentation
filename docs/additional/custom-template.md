TT documents are both readable by machines as well as by humans. Every TT document file is stored in a `.json` format, allowing any application to process the content within.

However, to present the data file in a human-readable format, a renderer needs to be written to decribe the parameters of how the document should look. Find out more about how to write a renderer [here](/docs/advanced/custom-renderer).
