Before being able to interact with the created key in AWS, you will need to retrieve your account's access key ID and secret access key.

At the top right of the AWS dashboard, look for your user account and go to `My Security Credentials`. Over here, you'll need to create access key.

Take note of the generated `Access key ID` and `Secret access key`, you will need these later on.
