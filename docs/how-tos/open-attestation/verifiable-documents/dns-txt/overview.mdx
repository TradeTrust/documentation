Building upon OpenAttestation framework, our Verifiable Document form one of two core pillars for TradeTrust framework.

In this tutorial guide, you will be deploying a verifiable document.

## Goal

By the end of this guide, you would be able to create your ðŸ“œ Certificate of Completion that is valid on any compatible TradeTrust Verifier. The following guides are available:

- Issue a TradeTrust Verifiable document that interacts with Ethereum Smart Contract.

Before we begin, lets take some time to understand the overall architecture of our verifiable documents.

### Overview of Verifiable Documents (through a document store)

![Overview of Components](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/ethereum/overview/overview.png)

#### Document Store Smart Contract

The document store is a smart contract deployed onto the blockchain. When a TradeTrust document is issued, a proof of the issuance is stored onto the blockchain through the smart contract.

The smart contract is used to provide a globally consistent record for anyone to query a given TradeTrust document's issuance status.

#### DNS Records

A domain is required to issue a TradeTrust document. A DNS record must be inserted to the DNS to assert the identity of the TradeTrust document issuer.

#### Verifiable Document File

A Verifiable Document File is also known as the TradeTrust document. Machine-readable data of the TradeTrust document is stored in a `.json` file. In addition to the data, these `.json` files also contain information such as:

- claim of issuer's identity
- document rendering information
- document store smart contract

#### Decentralized Renderer

The decentralized renderer gives the TradeTrust document a human-readable look. It is essentially a website which will take a TradeTrust document data as input and display the document in a web view. This allows anyone to style their document without submitting code change to another party.

This tutorial will now require you to choose between the following options:

- [CLI](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/verifiable-documents/dns-txt/deploying-document-store/document-store-cli)
- [Code](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/verifiable-documents/dns-txt/deploying-document-store/document-store-code)
