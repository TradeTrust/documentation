> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/verifiable-documents/dns-did/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) or [Code](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/verifiable-documents/dns-did/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-code).

Every TradeTrust document has a checksum that provides it a tamper-proof property. At the same time, because the checksum can be used to uniquely identify a document, the checksum (or its derived value) will be signed as evidence of issuance. To compute the checksum, a `raw document` goes through a process known as `wrapping` to become a `wrapped document`. Only then, the document is ready to be signed.

Multiple documents can be wrapped at the same time in a single batch operation, creating a single checksum for the entire batch of raw documents. This is especially useful when using document store on the Ethereum blockchain to lower the transaction cost and time.

In this guide, we will learn how to generate the checksum by running the `wrapping` process.

We will use the CLI tool to read all the files in the `raw-documents` folder, wrap them and then output the files in another directory `wrapped-documents`.

A `merkleRoot`, a 64 character long string prepended with `0x` will be generated.

From the folder containing the `raw-documents` folder, run:

```sh
tradetrust wrap raw-documents --output-dir wrapped-documents
âœ”  success   Batch Document Root: 0x80cc53b77c0539fc383f8d434ac5ffad281f3d64ae5a0e59e9f36f19548e1fff
```

After running the CLI you will see the success message with the `Batch Document Root`. In the above sample, the document root (also known as merkle root) is `0x80cc53b77c0539fc383f8d434ac5ffad281f3d64ae5a0e59e9f36f19548e1fff`, you will definitely have a different value.

> Save this value for future reference.

At the same time, you will notice that another directory, `wrapped-document`, has been created:

```text
wallet.json
raw-documents
  |-- certificate-1.json
  |-- certificate-2.json
wrapped-documents
  |-- certificate-1.json
  |-- certificate-2.json
```

In the `wrapped-document` directory, you will find the wrapped document which can be sent to the recipient later once the `merkleRoot` has been issued to the document store.

Now let us take a look at a wrapped document.

        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "signature": {
    "type": "SHA3MerkleProof",

  }
}
```

The `signature` section includes the fields of `targetHash` and `merkleRoot`.

`signature.targetHash` is the generated hash of the document, computed on the algorithm stated on the `signature.type`.

In this scenario, `signature.merkleRoot` will not be the same as `signature.targetHash` as we just did a batch wrapping of the documents.

Please keep in mind that if we were to wrap a single file, the `signature.merkleRoot` and the `signature.targetHash` will be the same.

Congratulation! you have successfully wrapped the documents, next lets see how we can sign the documents to 'issue' it.
