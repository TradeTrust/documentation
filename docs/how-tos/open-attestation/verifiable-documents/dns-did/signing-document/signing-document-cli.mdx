import Flow from "../flow.mdx";

> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/verifiable-documents/dns-did/signing-document/signing-document-cli) or [Code](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/verifiable-documents/dns-did/signing-document/signing-document-code).

After wrapping the documents and obtaining a merkle root, the documents are ready to be signed. Each documents will be signed individually, and the proof of the signature will be appended into the signed documents.

## Signing the documents

```bash
tradetrust sign ./wrapped-documents --od ./signed-documents --public-key did:ethr:0xaCc51f664D647C9928196c4e33D46fd98FDaA91D#controller --key 0x7b227ac59116f3eeb2b265422cf3cbfbd244c525961fb297eb52153ec62aa845
```

In the example above:

- `public-key` the public key used [to bind the wallet address with the DNS location](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/verifiable-documents/dns-did/dns#creating-temporary-dns-proof-with-cli)
- `key` is the wallet private key, generated when [creating the wallet](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/prerequisites#wallet-creation)

```text
âœ”  success   Signed documents saved to ./signed-documents
```

## Verifying the documents

Head over to [dev.tradetrust.io](https://dev.tradetrust.io/verify), drag and drop in one of the signed documents. The document will be verified, then displayed like in the image below.
