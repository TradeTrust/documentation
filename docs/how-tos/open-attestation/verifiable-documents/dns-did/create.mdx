While there exists many [DIDs](/docs/topics/appendix/glossary#did), this tutorial will focus only on `ethr` DID. At the moment, TradeTrust only supports `ethr` DID.

The creation of an `ethr` DID is identical to the creation of a wallet, as it relies entirely on the ethereum architecture. Once the wallet will be created, we will need to retrieve its private key:

- Using the [wallet created in the prerequisite step](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/prerequisites#wallet-creation), we run this command on the CLI to retrieve the private key:

  ```bash
   tradetrust wallet decrypt wallet.json
  ```

  ```text
  ⚠  warning   You are about to reveal the private key of your wallet. Please type the following word into the terminal to prove that you understand the risks: environmental-maroon-scorpion
  ? ack: environmental-maroon-scorpion

  ✔  success   Wallet information:
   - address: 0xaCc51f664D647C9928196c4e33D46fd98FDaA91D
   - public key: 0x041582ae06ae170b4c5610599c8a5fee37414da84f7e2a3b3c48789199c3202f2c7673f3e32dfead4543247ccb792aa4f54dbd3e701172723434e88f770dd64823
   - private key 0x7b227ac59116f3eeb2b265422cf3cbfbd244c525961fb297eb52153ec62aa845
  ```

There are two information to keep very importantly for the next steps:

- the wallet address (`0xaCc51f664D647C9928196c4e33D46fd98FDaA91D` in the example above)
- the private key (`0x7b227ac59116f3eeb2b265422cf3cbfbd244c525961fb297eb52153ec62aa845` in the example above)

Please note that you will definitely get different values.

> In order to make the tutorial easier to follow, we decided to reveal all the information about the wallet we used, including the private key. We used a throw-away wallet for that purpose. That means that we will never use this wallet again. It's very important that you **NEVER SHARE THE PRIVATE KEY** of your wallet.

Next, we will be constructing the DID string.

All you need to do is to append the wallet address to the `did:ethr:` string.

For example, the DID string will be `"did:ethr:0xaCc51f664D647C9928196c4e33D46fd98FDaA91D"`.

Once you have the DID string, you can check your DID at
https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:ethr:CHANGE_BY_YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS (for instance with [check this url](https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:ethr:0xaCc51f664D647C9928196c4e33D46fd98FDaA91D) with the example above)
)

Remember the DID string, `"did:ethr:<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>"`, as it will be used in the next step.
