Every TradeTrust document's provenance can be verified and traced back to its issuer. This is achieved by embedding an `identityProof`
property in the document, which serves as a claim for identity. During the verification phase, the claim is checked against
external records.

![Example Issuer Identity](/docs/tutorial/verifiable-documents/ethereum/dns-proof/example.png)

In this example above, the document's issuer is bound to `example.tradetrust.io`.

In this guide, we will bind the document issuer's identity to a valid domain name. This domain will be displayed as issuer every time the document is rendered in any TradeTrust-compliant decentralized renderer.

We will be inserting a temporary DNS record on our DNS at `sandbox.openattestation.com` so you do not need your own domain to follow the guide. If you prefer to use your own domain name for the identity, you may skip the steps involving the CLI and instead read the [DNS Configuration Guide](/docs/how-tos/issuer/dns-txt#hands-on-creating-a-dns-txt-record).

## DNS Configuration

To do that simply create a `TXT` record on your domain with the following entry:

```txt
openatts net=ethereum netId=11155111 addr=0x8431012Bc040942B59e3C5bf428221eab0b2f723
```

You will need to replace the token registry address `0x8431012Bc040942B59e3C5bf428221eab0b2f723` with the address you've got from the previous step.

## Creating Temporary DNS Proof with CLI

With your [token registry address](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/transferable-records/token-registry/token-registry-cli) that you get from the previous step, run the following command:

```sh
tradetrust dns txt-record create --address 0x8431012Bc040942B59e3C5bf428221eab0b2f723 --network-id 11155111
```

The `network-id` corresponds to the [network ID for the different Ethereum networks](https://chainid.network/). We generally use only the following networks:

| Network ID | Name                     | Network   |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| `1`        | Ethereum Mainnet         | `mainnet` |
| `11155111` | Ethereum Testnet Sepolia | `sepolia` |

Once the DNS TXT record has been successfully deployed, you will see the success message with the bound location.

```text
✔  success   Record created at few-green-cat.sandbox.openattestation.com and will stay valid until Thu Jul 02 2020 14:51:40 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)
```

In the example above, the document store `0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b`, has been bound to the `few-green-cat.sandbox.openattestation.com` location. Let's make sure the entry has been propagated to the DNS:

```bash
open-attestation dns txt-record get --location few-green-cat.sandbox.openattestation.com
```

which will display to you the list of the DNS TXT records associated to that location.

```text
┌─────────┬────────────┬────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────┐
│ (index) │    type    │    net     │     netId     │                     addr                     │ dnssec │
├─────────┼────────────┼────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┤
│    0    │ 'openatts' │ 'ethereum' │   '11155111'  │ '0xBBb55Bd1D709955241CAaCb327A765e2b6D69c8b' │ false  │
└─────────┴────────────┴────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────┘
```

> Note that it can take some time for the record to be correctly propagated to the DNS, even though it usually takes 10 to 15s.

> Take note that the dns entry is temporary and will be wiped out within a few days

Next, lets take a look at creating a raw transferable records document.
