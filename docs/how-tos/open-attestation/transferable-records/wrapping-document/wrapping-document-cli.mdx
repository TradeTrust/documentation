> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/transferable-records/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) or [Code](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/transferable-records/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-code).

Every TradeTrust document has a checksum that provides it a tamper-proof property. At the same time, because the checksum can be used to uniquely identify a document, the checksum (or its derived value) will be issued into the token registry as evidence of issuance. To compute the checksum, a `raw document` goes through a process known as `wrapping` to become a `wrapped document`. Only then, the document is ready to be issue.

> Please note that for Transferable Records, there is **NO** batch wrapping.

In this guide, we will learn how to generate the checksum by running the `wrapping` process.

We will use the CLI tool to read all the files in the `raw-documents` folder, wrap them and then output the files in another directory `wrapped-documents`.

A `merkleRoot`, a 64 character long string prepended with `0x` will be generated. The `merkleRoot` is the only information that will be stored onto the Blockchain to verify the issuance status of a TradeTrust document.

From the folder containing the `raw-documents` folder, run:

```sh
tradetrust wrap raw-documents --output-dir wrapped-documents
âœ”  success   Batch Document Root: 0x80cc53b77c0539fc383f8d434ac5ffad281f3d64ae5a0e59e9f36f19548e1fff
```

After running the CLI you will see the success message with the `Batch Document Root`. In the above sample, the document root (also known as merkle root) is `0x80cc53b77c0539fc383f8d434ac5ffad281f3d64ae5a0e59e9f36f19548e1fff`, you will definitely have a different value.

> Save this value for future reference.

At the same time, you will notice that another directory, `wrapped-document`, has been created:

```text
wallet.json
raw-documents
  |-- certificate-1.json
wrapped-documents
  |-- certificate-1.json
```

In the `wrapped-document` directory, you will find the wrapped document which can be sent to the recipient later once the `merkleRoot` has been issued to the token registry.

Now let us take a look at a wrapped document.

```json

        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "signature": {
    "type": "SHA3MerkleProof",
    "targetHash": "d83534d672d96753ea3cb50ac63129782a1c345d98b1141f9fe5449f1c225601",
    "proof": [],
    "merkleRoot": "d83534d672d96753ea3cb50ac63129782a1c345d98b1141f9fe5449f1c225601"
  }
}
```

The `signature` section includes the fields of `targetHash` and `merkleRoot`.

`signature.targetHash` is the generated hash of the document, computed on the algorithm stated on the `signature.type`.

In this scenario, `signature.merkleRoot` will be the same as `signature.targetHash` as we just did a wrapping of a single document.

Congratulation! you have successfully wrapped the document, next lets see how we can mint the documents to 'issue' it.
