> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/transferable-records/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-cli) or [Code](/docs/how-tos/open-attestation/transferable-records/wrapping-document/wrapping-document-code).

Every TradeTrust document has a checksum that provides it a tamper-proof property. At the same time, because the checksum can be used to uniquely identify a document, the checksum (or its derived value) will be issued into the token registry as evidence of issuance. To compute the checksum, a `raw document` goes through a process known as `wrapping` to become a `wrapped document`. Only then, the document is ready to be issue.

> Please note that for Transferable Records, there is **NO** batch wrapping.

In this guide, we will learn how to generate the checksum by running the `wrapping` process.

We will use the CLI tool to read all the files in the `raw-documents` folder, wrap them and then output the files in another directory `wrapped-documents`.

A `merkleRoot`, a 64 character long string prepended with `0x` will be generated. The `merkleRoot` is the only information that will be stored onto the Blockchain to verify the issuance status of a TradeTrust document.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @trustvc/trustvc
```

## Usage

### Wrapping documents

`wrapOADocument` takes in a documents and returns the wrapped document. Upon validating the document against it's schema, the document hash will be computed, to be placed onto the `signature` section of the wrapped document. The `signature` is to be used for integrity verification on the later stage of the tutorial.

```js
import { wrapOADocument } from '@trustvc/trustvc';
const document = {
  id: "SERIAL_NUMBER_123",
  $template: {
    name: "CUSTOM_TEMPLATE",
    type: "EMBEDDED_RENDERER",
    url: "https://localhost:3000/renderer",
  },
  issuers: [
    {
      name: "DEMO STORE",
      tokenRegistry: "0x9178F546D3FF57D7A6352bD61B80cCCD46199C2d",
      identityProof: {
        type: "DNS-TXT",
        location: "tradetrust.io",
      },
    },
  ],
  recipient: {
    name: "John Doe",
  }
} as any;

const wrappedDocument = wrapOADocument(document);
console.log(wrappedDocument);

// wrapped Document

        }
      }
    ],
    "recipient": {
      "name": "c2bab1ae-37d2-4b7a-86c1-f300edc4e6d2:string:John Doe"
    }
  },

  }
}
```

The `signature` section includes the fields of `targetHash` and `merkleRoot`.

`signature.targetHash` is the generated hash of the document, computed on the algorithm stated on the `signature.type`.

In the scenerio of `wrapOADocument`, `signature.merkleRoot` will be the same as `signature.targetHash`.

> Note:
> Transferable Records are limited to the `wrapOADocument` method.
> Merkle Root cannot be used to uniquely identified seperate transferable records.
>
> wrapOADocument:
>
> - returns an object.
> - The object is a wrapped document corresponding to the one provided as input.
> - The object has an unique `targetHash` value based on the input.
> - The object has an unique `merkleRoot` value which correspond to the `targetHash`.

:::tip
To extract the merkle root, refer to the example below

```ts
const merkleRoot: string = wrappedDocument.signature.targetHash;
```

Congratulation! you have successfully wrapped the documents, next lets see how we can mint the document to 'issue' it.
