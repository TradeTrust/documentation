TradeTrust is a framework that is built using [TrustVC](https://github.com/TrustVC) framework as its base by IMDA.

TradeTrust comprises globally-accepted standards such as W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs). In addition to the standards, TradeTrust connects governments and businesses to a public blockchain to enable trusted interoperability of electronic transferable records (ETRs) across digital platforms and it is offered as a digital utility.

TradeTrust is designed to provide industry the means to verify the authenticity and source of a document, as well as to create Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) that are functionally equivalent to their paper versions (e.g. able to effect title transfers)
