This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to verify the authenticity and integrity of a signed Verifiable Credential (VC) using the w3c-cli tool. The verification process ensures that the credential has not been tampered with and validates the issuerâ€™s signature.

Prerequisites:

- Install the w3c-cli tool on your system.
- Ensure you have the JSON file of the signed Verifiable Credential (e.g., signed_vc.json).

### Installation

Install CLI:

> Note Remember to install the cli globally

```bash
npm install -g @trustvc/w3c-cli
```

### Verification Process

Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.

Run the verify command:

```bash
w3c-cli verify
```

Provide the path to your Verifiable Credential JSON file when prompted:

```bash
? Please enter the path to your verifiable credential JSON file: ./signed_vc.json
```

Replace ./signed_vc.json with the path to your credential file if it is located in a different directory.

`View the verification result:` After running the command, you will receive an output similar to the following:

```bash
Verification result: true
Credential status verification result: "revocation:false"
```

Verification result: true indicates that the cryptographic proofs in the credential are valid and the credential has not been altered.

Credential status verification result: "revocation:false" confirms that the credential has not been revoked.

### Notes

Ensure that the credential file is in the correct JSON format and adheres to the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model.

If the verification fails, double-check the file path and the format of the credential JSON file.

If the status verification shows revocation:true, it means the credential has been revoked and is no longer valid.
