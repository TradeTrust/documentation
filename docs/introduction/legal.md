TradeTrust Framework addresses legal and technological challenges in using electronic bills of lading (eBLs) by aligning with the UNCITAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR). This allows eBLs to be supported by statutory law in compliant jurisdictions, rather than relying on contract law.

TradeTrust Framework aims to provide greater legal certainty and facilitate end-to-end digital trade by enabling the creation and management of MLETR-compliant electronic transferable records.
