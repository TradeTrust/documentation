> For the current step, you can either opt to use the [CLI](/docs/introduction/key-components-of-tradetrust/w3c-vc/signing-documents/signing-document-cli) or [Code](/docs/introduction/key-components-of-tradetrust/w3c-vc/signing-documents/signing-document-code).

> Only while using `bitstring` for **Credential Status**, the list can be configured as either a **revocation list** or a **suspension list**, depending on the use case.

Each documents will be signed individually, and the proof of the signature will be appended into the signed documents.

## Signing the documents

### Installation

Install CLI:

> Note Remember to install the cli globally

```bash
npm install -g @trustvc/w3c-cli
```

### Signing

Run the Command
Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
w3c-cli sign
```

The tool will prompt you to provide the path to your key pair file.

```bash
? Please enter the path to your key pair JSON file: ./didKeyPairs.json
```

Next, you will be asked to provide the path to your Verifiable Credential file.

    ```bash
    ? Please enter the path to your credential JSON file: ./vc.json
    ```

Provide the directory path where the signed credential will be saved.

    ```bash
    ? Please specify a directory path to save your signed verifiable credential: .
    ```
    The . indicates the current directory. You can specify a different path if needed.

Once the process is complete, the signed credential will be saved to the specified location.

```bash
Signed credential saved successfully to ./signed_vc.json
```

In this example, the signed credential is saved as signed_vc.json in the current directory.

```bash
$ w3c-cli sign
? Please enter the path to your key pair JSON file: ./didKeyPairs.json
? Please enter the path to your credential JSON file: ./vc.json
? Please specify a directory path to save your signed verifiable credential: .
Signed credential saved successfully to ./signed_vc.json
```

The CLI digitally signs a Verifiable Credential using the signCredential function from the w3c-vc repository, ensuring that the credential is tamper-evident and can be trusted by external verifiers.

Commands
The CLI provides several commands to help users interact with DIDs and Verifiable Credentials:
