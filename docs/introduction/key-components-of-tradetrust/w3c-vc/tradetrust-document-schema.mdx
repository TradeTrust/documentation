To explain on TradeTrust's document schema, we will use a sample document. For this example, a verifiable document will be used.

Below is w3c vc schema which is more aligned with [W3C VC data model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).

## Raw document

Let's take a closer look at a raw document:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2",
    "https://trustvc.io/context/transferable-records-context.json",
    "https://trustvc.io/context/render-method-context-v2.json",
    "https://trustvc.io/context/attachments-context.json",
    "https://trustvc.io/context/bill-of-lading.json"
  ],
  "credentialStatus": {
    "type": "TransferableRecords",
    "tokenNetwork": {
      "chain": "ETH",
      "chainId": "1337"
    },
    "tokenRegistry": "0x9Eb613a88534E2939518f4ffBFE65F5969b491FF",
    "tokenId": "e52a60e9c1308960bcf1d6c8531c58bf480aec373e1e3442a6af151475c3f89d"
  },
  "renderMethod": [
    {
      "id": "https://generic-templates.tradetrust.io",
      "type": "EMBEDDED_RENDERER",
      "templateName": "BILL_OF_LADING"
    }
  ],
  "credentialSubject": {
    "shipperAddressStreet": "",
    "consigneeName": "",
    "notifyPartyName": "",
    "blNumber": "20250107",
    "scac": "20250107"
  }
}
```

## Key fields in the schema

**1. @context**

The @context field defines the vocabulary and data schema used in the document. Each URL specifies a context that provides definitions for terms used within the document.

Key entries in this example:

- https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2: Defines the core Verifiable Credential terms.
- https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2: Provides support for Data Integrity proofs and ECDSA-SD-2023 cryptographic suite.
- https://trustvc.io/context/*: Custom contexts specific to the trustvc framework for handling transferable records and attachments.
- https://trustvc.io/context/bill-of-lading.json: Defines data for a bill of lading under the TradeTrust framework.

**2. credentialStatus**
Describes the status and ownership transferability of the credential.

Key fields:

- `type`: Indicates the status type; in this case, it is TransferableRecords, showing the record can be transferred.
- `tokenNetwork`: Details the blockchain network where the token is managed.
  chain: Blockchain type (e.g., ETH for Ethereum).
  - _chain_: Blockchain type (e.g., ETH for Ethereum).
  - _chainId_: Identifier for the specific Ethereum network (e.g., 1337 for a local development network).
- `tokenRegistry`: The smart contract address where the records are registered.
- `tokenId`: A unique identifier for the record, usually derived cryptographically.

**3. renderMethod**
Describes how the document should be rendered, often as a visual representation for human consumption.

Key fields:

- `id`: URL pointing to the renderer used for rendering the document.
- `type`: Specifies the rendering method, which is always EMBEDDED_RENDERER for documents rendered directly via a linked renderer.
- `templateName`: Indicates the specific template used for rendering; here, it's BILL_OF_LADING.

**4. credentialSubject**
Contains the main data related to the credential, which varies depending on the document type. In this schema:

- `shipper`: Details about the shipping party.
- `consignee`: Information about the recipient of the goods.
- `notifyParty`: Contact details of the party to be notified upon shipment arrival.
- `blNumber`: Bill of Lading number, a unique identifier for the shipment.
- `scac`: Standard Carrier Alpha Code, identifying the shipping line.

### Flexible Fields

The TradeTrust framework allows customization for specific document types:

credentialSubject data varies with document types (e.g., bills of lading, invoices).
@context can be extended with additional definitions to meet specific use cases.

> The other fields in the document are dependant on the type of document you want to use. They will differ accordingly, as TradeTrust framework does not restrict the data of your document.
