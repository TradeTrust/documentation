### Bitstring Status List
A method to track the status of credentials (e.g., revocation) using a bitstring, where each bit represents the current status of a credential in a list.

### Sign
The process of generating a digital signature using a private key and a signing algorithm to authenticate a document or transaction.

### Signature
A digital cryptographic value generated during the signing process, used to verify the authenticity of a document or transaction.

### Smart Contract
A self-executing contract where the terms of the agreement are written into code, and execution is automatically triggered on a blockchain.

### Verifiable Credentials (VC)
Digital credentials that follow the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, enabling statements about a subject to be expressed in a verifiable and cryptographically secure manner.  
[Learn more](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)

### W3C VC Data Model v1.1
The W3C standard for Verifiable Credentials, detailing the structure, semantics, and verification mechanisms for VCs.
