    title: "TradeTrust Documentation",
    description: "Working with various agencies and industry partners both locally and overseas, Singapore seeks to develop an interoperability framework, \“TradeTrust\”, for the exchange of digital trade documentation. This will enable a more seamless and efficient flow of goods between digitally inter-connected trading partners. TradeTrust consists of a set of governance and legal frameworks, standards and a future-ready digital infrastructure, to facilitate the interoperability of electronic trade documents exchanged between different digital ecosystems. It aims to reduce inefficiencies and complexities of cross-border trade arising from the current usage of paper-based documentation, such as bills of lading. This lowers operating costs for businesses and the risk of fraud while accelerating the digitalisation of cross-border trade processes thereby promoting more growth in trade.",
